# BicycleSafety
This is the work of CSM Field Session 2021 for the Chad William Young Foundation.

The code in this repository takes an existing algorithm created by a past senior design project and adapts it to work with Strava's API v3. It does route searches data from Strava's available information, and turns the latitude, longitude, distance, and elevation of those routes into a drawn heat map of potential hazardous areas.

Information about the project and the project's history can be found in the Final Reports included in this github. Instructions for installing the work in a coding environment for future development can also be found inside the final report's appendix.
